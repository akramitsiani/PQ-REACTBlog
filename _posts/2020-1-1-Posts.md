Quantum Processing Unit (QPU)  
A Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) is the core module responsible for performing computations in a quantum computer. It serves as the central processing element, executing the tasks required for quantum algorithms. Quantum infrastructures are being deployed to host and test various external tools, enabling the expansion of their functionalities and supporting research and development in the field.    
    
Quantum Oracle    
Quantum algorithms often rely on structures known as "oracles," which are essentially black-box circuits used to encode input data. The quantum oracle functions as a gateway through which different algorithms and mechanisms can be tested and validated against the QPU. It also provides an interface for external systems, acting as a translator that facilitates interaction between classical computing systems and quantum processors. This allows various quantum cryptographic algorithms and other computations to be evaluated.  
    
Validation Engine  
In order to ensure the reliability of quantum cryptographic mechanisms and related systems, automated testing tools are essential. A validation engine is responsible for testing quantum algorithms, cryptographic migration processes, and the overall functionality of the system. This engine supports the detection of failures, whether related to specific algorithms or broader system processes. It may also incorporate security measures to prevent malicious implementations or flawed algorithms from being deployed on quantum computing infrastructure. Additionally, the validation engine can modify legacy software and integrate test cases directly into the development pipeline.
