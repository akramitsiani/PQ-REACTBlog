In the past 30 years, public key cryptography has become a crucial part of the world’s digital communication systems. These systems help us do important things like:
-Using mobile phones
-Shopping online
-Using social networks
-Storing data in the cloud
</div> 
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Cryptography ensures that individuals, businesses, and governments can communicate securely. Most secure communications rely on three main methods:
1. Public key encryption (protecting data)
2. Digital signatures (authenticating information)
3. Key exchange (securely sharing encryption keys)
</div> 
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Currently, these methods use:  
-Diffie-Hellman key exchange  
-RSA cryptosystem (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)  
-Elliptic curve cryptosystems  
</div> 
<div style="text-align: justify;">
These systems rely on math problems that are nearly impossible to solve with today's computers. But if quantum computers become powerful enough, they could solve these problems quickly, making current cryptography unsafe. In fact:  
-In 1994, Peter Shor developed a quantum algorithm that could break public key cryptosystems like RSA.  
-Symmetric cryptography (like AES) is more resistant to quantum attacks, but it would still need larger key sizes to stay secure due to Grover’s algorithm.  
</div> 
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Even though quantum computers that can break encryption don’t exist yet, we need to prepare now for the future. That’s why organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are working to find post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms that can resist quantum attacks.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Key Challenges:  
-Massive Internet usage: With 4.1 billion users and $3 trillion in online retail, switching to quantum-safe cryptography will be a huge task.  
-Diverse systems: Computers and devices across the world use different technologies, making the switch complex.  
</div> 
<div style="text-align: justify;">
PQ-REACT Project Goals:  
-Design a framework for a smooth transition from current cryptography to post-quantum cryptography.  
-Develop migration paths and methods to help systems switch to PQC.  
-Create tools to validate and test quantum-safe cryptographic systems.  
-Ensure that users can switch to PQC based on their specific needs, like delay, memory, bandwidth, and power usage.
