Quantum computing has the potential to generate up to $850 billion in value globally over the next 15 to 30 years, according to a recent report from the Boston Consulting Group. However, Europe risks falling behind key players like the US and China in this rapidly evolving field. In response to this challenge, PQReact aims to take decisive action in the quantum race, positioning the EU as a leader in quantum computing innovation. The project focuses on advancing cryptographic technologies and enhancing cybersecurity, which are crucial for safeguarding sensitive data in the quantum era. By driving novel developments in these areas, PQReact seeks to reinforce Europeâ€™s competitiveness and secure its place at the forefront of quantum technological advancements.
